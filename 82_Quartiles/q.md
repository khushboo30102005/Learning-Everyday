# Quartiles in Statistics  
### (The Secret Behind Box Plots)

---

## 1. What are Quartiles?

Quartiles are **positional measures** in statistics that divide a dataset into **four equal parts** after arranging the data in ascending order.

Each part contains **25% of the data**.

---

## 2. Types of Quartiles

### 🔹 First Quartile (Q1)
- Also called **Lower Quartile**
- Separates the **lowest 25%** of data from the rest
- Represents the 25th percentile

---

### 🔹 Second Quartile (Q2)
- Also called **Median**
- Divides the data into **two equal halves**
- Represents the 50th percentile

---

### 🔹 Third Quartile (Q3)
- Also called **Upper Quartile**
- Separates the **lowest 75%** of data from the top 25%
- Represents the 75th percentile

## 3. Quartiles Example

Given data (already sorted):  
`2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16`

- **Q2 (Median)** = (8 + 10) / 2 = 9  
- **Q1** = Median of lower half (2,4,6,8) = (4 + 6) / 2 = 5  
- **Q3** = Median of upper half (10,12,14,16) = (12 + 14) / 2 = 13

## 4. Interquartile Range (IQR)

**IQR = Q3 − Q1**

- Measures the spread of the **middle 50%** of data
- Less affected by extreme values (outliers)

---

## 5. Quartiles and Box Plot

A **Box Plot** is built using:
- Minimum value
- **Q1**
- **Median (Q2)**
- **Q3**
- Maximum value

📦 Box plots help visualize:
- Data distribution
- Skewness
- Outliers
- Variability

## 6. Role of Quartiles in Data Science & AI

Quartiles are widely used for:
- 📊 Outlier detection
- 🧹 Data cleaning
- 📈 Understanding data spread
- 🤖 Feature analysis in ML models



## 8. Summary

Quartiles simplify complex datasets by breaking them into meaningful parts.  
They form the backbone of **box plots** and play a crucial role in **statistical analysis and data science**.
