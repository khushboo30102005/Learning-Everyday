# MARKDOWN
### Introduction


Markdown is a lightweight markup language. Created by John Gruber in 2004, Markdown is now one of the worldâ€™s most popular markup languages.

The extension for a Markdown file is .md or .markdown. To compile a markdown file you need an application capable of processing markdown files like Microsoft Word, Dillinger, etc. These applications use a Markdown processor or parser which converts a markdown file to printable HTML code.
