# 📊 Dispersion in Statistics

## 1. Introduction
**Dispersion** refers to the extent to which data values are **spread or scattered** around a central value such as the mean, median, or mode.

While measures of **central tendency** tell us where the data is centered, measures of dispersion tell us **how consistent or variable** the data is.

> Two datasets may have the same average but very different dispersion.

## 2. Importance of Dispersion
Dispersion helps to:
- Measure **variability and consistency**
- Compare two or more datasets
- Understand **risk and uncertainty**
- Support better **decision-making**
