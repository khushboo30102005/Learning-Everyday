# Statistics for AI: Mean, Median & Mode — Made Intuitive

## Overview

Mean, Median, and Mode are the **core measures of central tendency** in statistics. These concepts form the foundation of **Data Science, Artificial Intelligence, and Machine Learning**, especially during data understanding and preprocessing.

## 1. Mean (Arithmetic Mean)

### Definition

The **Mean** is the average value of a dataset.

### Formula

Mean (x̄) = (Sum of all observations) / (Number of observations)

### Example

Data: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10
Mean = (2+4+6+8+10)/5 = **6**

### When to Use

* To understand **overall trends** in data
* When data is **uniformly distributed**

### Limitation

* Highly affected by **outliers**

---

## 2. Median

### Definition

The **Median** is the middle value of an ordered dataset.

### Steps to Find Median

1. Arrange data in ascending order
2. If n is odd → Median = middle value
3. If n is even → Median = average of two middle values

### Example

Data: 2, 3, 5, 7, 100
Median = **5**

### When to Use

* When data contains **outliers or skewness**
* Income, salary, and real-world datasets

### Advantage

* Not affected by extreme values

---

## 3. Mode

### Definition

The **Mode** is the value that appears **most frequently** in a dataset.

### Example

Data: 2, 4, 4, 6, 8
Mode = **4**

### When to Use

* For **categorical data**
* To find the most common value

### Special Cases

* No mode: All values appear once
* More than one mode: Bimodal or Multimodal data

---

## Importance in AI & Data Science

* Data preprocessing and cleaning
* Feature understanding and analysis
* Handling missing values
* Decision-making in ML models

## Comparison Table

| Measure | Best Used When   | Affected by Outliers |
| ------- | ---------------- | -------------------- |
| Mean    | Data is balanced | Yes                  |
| Median  | Data is skewed   | No                   |
| Mode    | Categorical data | No                   |
