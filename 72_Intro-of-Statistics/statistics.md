## 🔹 What is Statistics?

Statistics is the branch of mathematics that deals with:

* Collecting data
* Organizing data
* Analyzing data
* Interpreting data
* Presenting data meaningfully

In simple terms, statistics turns **raw data into useful insights**.

---

## 🔹 Why Statistics is Important for Data Science & AI

* Helps in **understanding data behavior**
* Used in **data analysis and visualization**
* Forms the base of **Machine Learning algorithms**
* Supports **prediction, classification, and decision-making**
* Helps evaluate **model accuracy and performance**

Without statistics, data is just numbers — statistics gives data **meaning**.
