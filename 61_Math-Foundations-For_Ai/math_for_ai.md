### ✅ **Why Algebra Is the Backbone of ML**

Machine learning models learn patterns through **equations, variables,
and functions**.\
Linear equations → Linear Regression\
Quadratics & polynomials → Optimization problems

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 🎲 **How Probability & Statistics Shape AI Models**

AI = predicting outcomes.\
And prediction = **probability + statistics**.\
From Naive Bayes to decision trees --- everything depends on data
distributions.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 📐 **Vectors & Matrices: The Language of Neural Networks**

Neural networks work on:

-   vector addition
-   matrix multiplication
-   dot products

This is the math behind embeddings, weights, and activations.

### 🔁 **Calculus: The Engine Behind Gradient Descent**

Model training = minimizing errors.\
And minimization = **derivatives + slopes**.\
Gradient descent uses calculus to *learn* step by step.
