# D Programming Language

## 1. Introduction

D is a **general-purpose, statically typed, compiled programming language** created by **Walter Bright** and first released in **2001**. It is designed to combine the **performance of C/C++** with the **productivity of modern languages**.

D is mainly used for **system programming, application development, game engines, and performance-critical software**.

---

## 2. Why D Language?

D was created to overcome the complexity of C++ while keeping its power.

### Key Goals:

* High performance like C/C++
* Modern syntax and safety features
* Easier memory management
* Built-in support for concurrency

---

## 3. Features of D Language

### 3.1 Performance

* Compiled directly to **native machine code**
* Comparable speed to C and C++

### 3.2 Memory Management

* Supports **Garbage Collection (GC)**
* Allows **manual memory management** when needed

### 3.3 Modern Programming Support

* Functional programming
* Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
* Meta-programming
* Templates (simpler than C++)

### 3.4 Safety

* Strong static typing
* Array bounds checking
* Immutable data support

### 3.5 Concurrency

* Built-in concurrency model
* Avoids common threading issues

## 4. D vs C vs C++

| Feature            | C    | C++       | D      |
| ------------------ | ---- | --------- | ------ |
| Performance        | High | High      | High   |
| Complexity         | Low  | Very High | Medium |
| Garbage Collection | No   | No        | Yes    |
| Modern Syntax      | No   | Partial   | Yes    |
| Safety Features    | Low  | Medium    | High   |

## 5. Basic Structure of a D Program

```d
import std.stdio;

void main()
{
    writeln("Hello, D Language!");
}
```

### Explanation:

* `import std.stdio;` → Imports standard input/output library
* `void main()` → Entry point of the program
* `writeln()` → Prints output to console

---

## 6. Data Types in D

### Common Data Types:

* `int`
* `float`
* `double`
* `char`
* `bool`
* `string`

Example:

```d
int a = 10;
string name = "D Language";
bool isEasy = true;
```

---

## 7. Applications of D Language

* System programming
* Game development
* High-performance applications
* Scientific computing
* Web backends

---

## 8. Advantages of D Language

* High performance
* Cleaner syntax than C++
* Modern language features
* Strong community support
* Easier learning curve compared to C++

---

## 9. Limitations of D Language

* Smaller ecosystem compared to Java or Python
* Less popular in industry
* Fewer learning resources

---

## 10. Conclusion

D is a powerful language that bridges the gap between **low-level performance** and **high-level productivity**. It is an excellent choice for developers who want **C/C++ speed with modern programming features**.

---

📌 *D language did not gain popularity due to strong C++ dominance, smaller ecosystem, limited industry adoption, and unclear positioning.*
