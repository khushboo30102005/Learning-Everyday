## Are you chasing the wrong tech trends?

### 🚨 Trends = Trap

Tech trends change rapidly.  
Chasing every new framework or buzzword can slow down real growth.

### ✅ What actually matters

- **Build a strong foundation**
  - DSA
  - DBMS
  - OS
  - OOPs
- **Focus on your desired long-term goal**
- Master **concepts**, not just tools

### 💡 Final Thought

> Trends will come and go,  
> but **strong fundamentals stay forever**.
