# Independent vs Dependent Variables  
### Explained for AI & Data Science

**Day-91 | #100DaysLearningChallenge**

Understanding Independent and Dependent variables is a **core concept** in  
📊 Statistics, 🤖 Machine Learning, and 🧠 Data Science.

---

## 1. Independent Variable (X)

**Definition:**  
An **Independent Variable** is the variable that is **controlled, changed, or selected** to observe its effect on another variable.

### Key Points:
- Also called **Input Variable**
- Does **not depend** on other variables
- In ML, known as **Feature**

### Examples:
- Study hours  
- Age  
- Temperature  
- Years of experience

## 2. Dependent Variable (Y)

**Definition:**  
A **Dependent Variable** is the variable that **depends on the independent variable**. It is the outcome or result.

### Key Points:
- Also called **Output Variable**
- Changes when X changes
- In ML, known as **Target / Label**

### Examples:
- Exam score  
- Salary  
- Ice cream sales  
- House price

## 3. Simple Real-Life Example

| Independent (X) | Dependent (Y) |
|----------------|---------------|
| Study hours    | Exam marks    |
| Experience    | Salary        |
| Temperature   | AC power use  |

👉 If **X changes**, **Y responds**
