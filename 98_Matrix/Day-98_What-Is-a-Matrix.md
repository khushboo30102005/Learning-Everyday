# What Is a Matrix?

## Day-98 | #100DaysLearningChallenge

---

## 1. Introduction

A **matrix** is a rectangular arrangement of numbers, symbols, or expressions, organized in **rows** and **columns**.  
Matrices are a fundamental concept in **Linear Algebra** and form the mathematical backbone of **Machine Learning, Data Science, AI, and Computer Graphics**.

> A matrix is a table of values used to represent and manipulate data efficiently.

---

## 2. Structure of a Matrix

A matrix is usually represented by a capital letter such as **A**, **B**, or **M**.

Example:

[ 1  2  3 ]  
[ 4  5  6 ]

- Rows → Horizontal arrangement  
- Columns → Vertical arrangement  
- Order of matrix = Number of rows × Number of columns (2 × 3)

## 3. Elements of a Matrix

Each value inside a matrix is called an **element**.

- Element at row *i* and column *j* is written as **aᵢⱼ**
- Example: a₂₃ = 6

## 4. Types of Matrices

### 4.1 Row Matrix
A matrix with only one row.

### 4.2 Column Matrix
A matrix with only one column.

### 4.3 Square Matrix
Number of rows equals number of columns.

### 4.4 Zero Matrix
All elements are zero.

### 4.5 Identity Matrix
Diagonal elements are 1 and all others are 0.

---

## 5. Matrix Operations

### Matrix Addition
- Same order required
- Add corresponding elements

### Scalar Multiplication
Each element is multiplied by a constant.

### Matrix Multiplication
- Columns of first matrix = Rows of second matrix
- Order matters

## 6. Importance of Matrices in ML & AI

Matrices are used to represent:
- Datasets
- Images
- Neural network weights
- Transformations

Most ML algorithms rely heavily on matrix operations.

---

## 7. Real-World Example

Marks of 100 students in 5 subjects can be represented as a 100 × 5 matrix, making analysis and prediction easier.

---

## 8. Key Takeaways

- Matrix = structured data representation
- Core foundation for ML, AI, and Data Science
- Essential for understanding advanced algorithms

> If data is fuel, matrices are the engine of Machine Learning.
