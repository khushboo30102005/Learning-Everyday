# Standard Deviation (SD)

## 1. What is Standard Deviation?

**Standard Deviation** measures how much the data values deviate from the mean.  
It shows the **average spread of data** in the **same unit as the original data**.

- Low SD → Data points are close to the mean
- High SD → Data points are widely spread

## 2. Why Standard Deviation is Important

- Easy to interpret compared to variance
- Used in **statistics, data science, AI, finance, and risk analysis**
- Helps understand **data consistency and variability**

## 3. Formula

### (a) Population Standard Deviation

σ = √( Σ(x − μ)² / N )

Where:

- μ = population mean
- N = total number of observations

### (b) Sample Standard Deviation

s = √( Σ(x − x̄)² / (n − 1) )
Where:

- x̄ = sample mean
- n = number of observations

## 4. Step-by-Step Example

### Given Data

2, 4, 6

### Step 1: Calculate Mean

Mean = (2 + 4 + 6) / 3 = 4

### Step 2: Find Squared Deviations

(2 − 4)² = 4
(4 − 4)² = 0
(6 − 4)² = 4

### Step 3: Calculate Standard Deviation

SD = √2.67 ≈ 1.63

## 5. Key Characteristics

- Always **non-negative**
- Measured in **original units**
- Sensitive to **outliers**

## 6. Key Takeaway

**Standard Deviation** provides a clear and practical measure of data spread, making it one of the most important tools in statistical analysis.
