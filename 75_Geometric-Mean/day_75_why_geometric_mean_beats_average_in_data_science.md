## 📊 Why Geometric Mean Beats Average in Data Science

### 📌 What I Learned Today
In Data Science, choosing the **right measure of central tendency** is crucial. While the arithmetic mean (simple average) is commonly used, it can be misleading for **multiplicative or compounding data**. This is where the **Geometric Mean (GM)** becomes more meaningful.

### 🔍 Arithmetic Mean vs Geometric Mean

**Arithmetic Mean (AM):**
- Best for linear data
- Calculated by adding values and dividing by count
- Can be affected heavily by extreme values

**Geometric Mean (GM):**
- Best for multiplicative data
- Calculated by multiplying values and taking the nth root
- Handles growth rates and ratios accurately

---

### 📈 Why Geometric Mean is Better in Data Science
✔ Accurately represents **compounded growth**  
✔ Reduces the impact of **outliers**  
✔ Ideal for **percentages, ratios, and rates**  
✔ Widely used in finance, ML metrics, and performance evaluation

### 🧠 Key Insight
> **If your data multiplies, don’t average it — geometric mean it.**

This means whenever data values depend on each other through multiplication (like growth over time), geometric mean gives a **truer picture** than a simple average.

---

### 📝 Simple Example
Growth rates: +10% and −10%
- Arithmetic Mean = 0% (misleading)
- Geometric Mean shows a net loss due to compounding

---

### ✅ Exam & Interview Tip
Use **Geometric Mean** when dealing with:
- Growth rates
- Investment returns
- Accuracy improvements
- Population or performance metrics

### 🚀 Reflection
Understanding *when not to use average* is as important as knowing how to calculate it. Today’s learning strengthened my foundation in statistics for **AI and Data Science**.
